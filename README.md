> The powerful entity-based canvas rendering library

[GitHub](https://github.com/ethanent/canvax) | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvaxjs)

## Using canvax

The canvax library is super simple to use. To create a new renderer, go ahead and attach a new renderer to a canvas element.

```javascript
var game = new canvax.Renderer(document.querySelector('#myCanvas'))
```

## Install canvax

```
npm install canvaxjs
```

## Documentation

Full documentation will be arriving soon. Docs have been removed in canvax version 0.4.0, and hopefully new ones will take their place soon enough.

For now, though, look at the default properties in entities' model class files. (ex. [model/Rectangle.js](https://github.com/ethanent/canvax/blob/master/model/Rectangle.js))
